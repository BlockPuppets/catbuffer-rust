# catbuffer-rust

The catbuffer library helps serialize and deserialize NEM's Symbol entities in Rust applications.

The library's main client is the NEM Rust SDK [symbol-sdk-rust](https://github.com/BlockPuppets/symbol-sdk-rust) but it can be used alone.

It has been generated using [catbuffer-generators](https://github.com/nemtech/catbuffer-generators) from the [catbuffer](https://github.com/nemtech/catbuffer) specification.
